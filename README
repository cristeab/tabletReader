tabletReader is an e-book reader for touch enabled devices
It is written into C++ using Qt framework. Initially it has been sought 
as an e-book reader for Linux OSs, but Windows is also supported. Currently,
an Windows installer for version 2.0 has been submitted to Intel AppUp (http://www.appup.com/browse-apps/search?keyword=tabletReader&submit-search=).
